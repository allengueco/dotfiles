# dotfiles

My (very messy) dotfiles. I maintain this using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

For now, I don't have any install scripts. So to remind myself, I have these tools installed:
- brew
- oh-my-zsh
- fzf
- Neovim
- ripgrep
- bat
- eza
- delta

## Neovim Plugins 
My neovim plugins can be found [here](./home/dot_config/nvim/lua/allengueco/packer.lua).

## Theme
I've chosen to use [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) as my color scheme for most of my config.
Their [ports](https://catppuccin.com/ports) to various software help me make everything consistent.
