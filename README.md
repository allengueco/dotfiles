# dotfiles

My (very messy and eternally WIP) dotfiles. I maintain this using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

For now, I don't have any install scripts. So to remind myself, I have these tools installed (roughly in order of dependency):
- brew
- sdkman
- zsh
- oh-my-zsh
- fzf
- fd
- Neovim
- ripgrep
- bat
- eza
- delta
- nvm

## Theme
I've chosen to use [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) as my color scheme for most of my config.
Their [ports](https://catppuccin.com/ports) to various software help me make everything consistent.
